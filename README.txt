First clone this directory from github. 

To run make sure you have an updated version of node and npm installed on your machine.

Then use 'npm i' in this directory to get all the packages. 

You must also add this file (called '.env.local'):
  `
  REACT_APP_BACK_URL=http://localhost:8080
  `

You can start the front-end react app by then running 'node run start' in this directory.
